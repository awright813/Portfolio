"There are 39 'trifecta' states, in which a single party controls all three branches of government... This allows states to 'make decisions and make them relatively quickly', says Peverill Squire of the University of Missouri" - The Economist, January 2023

**In states with "trifecta" legislatures, where one party can pursue its legislative agenda freely, what is the impact on the state's economic growth?**
